# Caterpie Catcher

This is a project for the course CPSC 1045 - Intro to Web Programming - Langara College - Spring of 2020.

The game was developed to run in a browser, using Vanilla JavaScript, pure CSS and HTML.

## Disclaimer
Unfortunatelly, since it is a project still used to evaluate students, I could not share the project code.  
Instead, I am sharing the game video.  
Once I can post the complete code, I'll update the repo ^^
